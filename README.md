# Tarun Saxena Portfolio (Vite + React + Tailwind + Framer Motion + Router)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Notes
- The contact form is wired to EmailJS; replace the placeholder IDs in `src/components/Contact.jsx` with your EmailJS credentials.
- Project detail pages are implemented. Project data is in `src/data/projects.js`. Fill in `github`, `live`, and `video` fields with your URLs.
- Tailwind is configured; after `npm install`, the dev server will compile styles.
